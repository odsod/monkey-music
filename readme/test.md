Introduction
============

The Spotify backend is consists of a multitude of individual services.  One
such service is the music recommendation service, which is responsible for
finding and recommending new tracks to Spotify users, according to their music taste.

The music recommendation service has lately been getting some pretty negative
feedback from users. The word out on Twitter is that even monkeys could find
better music recommendations!

Therefore, upper management has made an informed decision that the next version
of the music recommendation service shall be operated entirely by monkeys. As
product manager for the music recommendation service, your job is to make sure
that the monkeys do a good job. 

You have therefore decided to write a computer program that helps monkeys find
good track recommendations for Spotify users.

This is all entirely fictional of course.

Task summary
============

The task consists of implementing a program to move a monkey around a level.
The monkey's mission is to score points by gathering track recommendations and
giving them to a Spotify user.

Level layout
------------

The level is a `n x m` grid of cells. It is sent to the standard input of your
program. 

Each cell contains one of the following things:

### Monkeys

* ASCII: `M[id]`

You, and your competitors each have your own monkey to control. 
Every monkey is identified by a unique numerical id.

### Walls

* ASCII: `#`

Walls are inanimate objects that monkeys cannot pass through.

### Tracks

* ASCII: `[URI]`

Tracks are identified by their unique Spotify URI. Every track URI starts with `spotify:track:`, 
followed by `22` alphanumerical characters. Example: `spotify:track:5H85hOp2oMlhMh9JlkdJP2`.
Tracks can be picked up and carried around by monkeys.

### The User

* ASCII: `U`

The user is where monkeys deliver their track recommendations. Monkeys are scored for every track
delivered to the user according to how well the track fits the user's music taste.

### Empty

* ASCII: `[SPACE]`

Nothing to do here.

A cell can only contain one thing at any time.

User toplists
-------------

How well track matches the music taste of a user is decided by the user's toplists.

Every Spotify user has a track toplist, an album toplist and an artist toplist. Every entry 
in a toplist is a comma-separated string of metadata.

The toplists are sent to the standard input of your program on the following formats:

### Track toplist

First an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of track metadata entries.

    n
    track,album,artist,year
    track,album,artist,year
    ...

### Album toplist

First an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of album metadata entries.

    n
    album,artist,year
    album,artist,year
    ...

### Artist toplist

First an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of artist metadata entries.

    n
    artist
    artist
    ...

### Disliked artist toplist

You will also receive a list of artists that the user does not like.

First an integer `n`, followed by `n` lines of artist entries.

    n
    artist
    artist
    ...

Spotify does not actually keep toplists of disliked artists.
{: .tip}

Track scoring
-------------

Each track is scored according to the user toplists by placing it into 1 out of 5 score tiers.

There are three positive tiers: `1`, `2` and `3`. There are two negative tiers, `-1` and `-2`

The following criteria decide which tier a track belongs to:

### Tier -2: Disliked artist

To recommend a track whose `artist` is among the user's disliked artist toplist is simply an epic fail.

### Tier -1: "SÃ¶nderlyssnad" 

When the `track` is already in the user's track toplist, there is not much
point in recommending it, is there?

### Tier += 1: Favorite artist

If the `artist` of the track is in the user's artist toplist, the track
will be bumped up one tier.

### Tier += 1: Favorite album

If the `album` of the track is in the user's album toplist, the track
will be bumped up one tier.

### Tier += 1: Favorite decade

This is an interesting one. Every user has a top decade, which is the
decade that is most prominent in the user's track toplist and album toplist.

If the `year` of the track belongs to the user's top decade, the track
will be bumped up one tier.

### Tally

Your track will be scored according to it's tier:

* Tier -2: -16 points
* Tier -1: -4 points
* Tier 1: 4 points
* Tier 2: 16 points
* Tier 3: 64 points

Tier 3 tracks are obviously very valuable, so be on the lookout for
these.

Monkey movement
---------------

Commands are sent from the standard output of your program. 
In each turn of the game, every monkey executes one command. 

Commands which the monkeys can execute are:

Move west
: ASCII: `W`
: Moves the monkey one cell to the left.

Move east
: ASCII: `E`
: Moves the monkey one cell to the right.

Move north
: ASCII: `N`
: Moves the monkey one cell up.

Move down
: ASCII: `N`
: Moves the monkey one cell down.

Metadata lookup
: ASCII: `[URI]`
: Queries the metadata for a track URI. You will recieve the metadata the following turn.

Boost
: ASCII: `B,[COMMAND],[COMMAND],[COMMAND]`
: Once every game, the monkey can issue a boost command and then issue three
: other comma separated commands during the same turn.

Your monkey must every turn choose between moving and looking up the metadata of a track!
{: .tip}

### Picking up tracks

Once a *Track* is picked up, there is no way to get rid of it but to
`deliver` it to the user, so make sure to stay away from negative tier
tracks.

### Delivering tracks

Quick start
===========

To install the challenge runtime:

    > gem install monkeymusic

To get started quickly:

    > monkeymusic demo

To see something on the screen:

    > monkeymusic -p demo_player

You can probably learn a lot about the game from reading the `demo_player`.

Also make sure to read the protocol examples at the end of the document.

Metadata fields are separated by double commas! (`,,`)
{: .tip}

The level
=========

Your monkey moves around in a flat 2D level. You can think of the level as
a matrix, where any square can be occupied by one thing at any given time.

     Xl     1 U 2     lX 
    t    ll       ll    t
    ###t ########### t###
    #t # #T tlTlt T# # t#
    ##   #T#l   l#T#   ##
    #l ######X X###### l#
    ##  #   # x #   #  ##
    #T#   #t#   #t#   #T#
    #x#l##### # #####l#x#
    #   #   # l #   #   #
    ### # # # # # # # ###
    #t    #   #   #    t#
    #l###l#t#t#t#t#l###l#

Every monkey is represented in the level by a numerical id:

* *Monkey*: `\d`

Besides monkeys, the level can also contain:

* *Tracks*: `spotify:track:......................`
* *Walls*: `#`
* *The User*: `U`

Your monkey has one mission: to find and deliver suitable track 
recommendations to *The User*.
